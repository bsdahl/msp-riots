I was being charged for an electric bill that I was originally told I was not going to have to pay for. Upon reaching out to Girard Management, they realized and owned up to their mistake and with only a couple of emails back and forth we reached an agreement that I think is more than fair for both parties. \n\nOn top of that, they made applying for my unit, signing my lease, and moving in very easy. I even found brand a new refrigerator and oven/stove in my apartment upon moving in that I wasn't expecting, signaling to me that they really care about keeping their units up to date. It has been one of the easiest management companies to work with in my experience from multiple cities. I have worked with Marquita, John, and Pam, and all three have been easy and fast to communicate with (something not easily found with management companies). \n\nThey use an app/website for rent/utility fees and maintenance reporting/tracking. It has been very nice not to have to write checks or something else outdated. Now I just log into my app on the first of the month and have four days to pay without incurring a late fee. The money is pulled straight from my bank account.

In the late afternoon on a cold December Saturday (around 10F) I noticed my normally warm and toasty apartment was chilly, and much to my horror all of the radiators were cold to the touch. I put in a call to the maintenance line, expecting to leave a voicemail, but a nice guy answered and wrote a maintenance request. Within 45 min, there was a maintenance guy knocking on my door to fix the issue. Having no heat during winter in Minnesota is no joke, and I was very impressed with how serious they took the matter and how efficiently it was corrected (on a Saturday night no less!). \n\nThe biggest issue I’ve experienced here was when I re-signed my lease this year - I signed and submitted it before my original lease ended, but it seemed as if they were behind on paperwork at the office, because for the next 3 months I was charged an extra $50 month to month lease fee. Each month I had to call the office, and while they removed the fee, it was still a pain that it kept happening. \n\nShoutout to Molly, the woman at the front desk, she should get employee of the month every month!

Everything you can think of. Many signed first editions. I had to limit myself or I'd go broke. I scored a bag full of first edition science fiction books by award winning authors... at the price you would normally pay for books with a lesser pedigree. The staff is incredible. They're not just clerks. They really know the science fiction genre. For their anniversary sale they offered 20% off with the purchase of a $4 saver card. And I got a free Uncle Edgar book bag. They have an online store as well.

After two plate I was already full. Nothing too special about it. Good variety. Didn’t try the grill but I would assume it’s the same as any other places. Sushi looks alright, didn’t try it. Caught the two waitress by the drinks area by the food, standing and waiting on their phones a couple times. I thought that was a little unprofessional and annoying. Would I come back? Probably not. I would rather go try somewhere else as there is plenty of other similar buffet here in the twin cities. They seem to like to emphasize on the “tip is not included” as its on both their napkin dispenser and fortune cookie plate (which usually means, like everywhere else, when they give that to you it’s time for you to go; ha).

They had just delivered their first baby the day before. Upon my daughter's discharge, my son in law picked up the vase to transport it home. It shattered in his hand leaving him with a large gash. Instead of taking his family home, he ended up in the ER needing several stitches. To prevent this from happening to someone else, he called the store to notify them of the faulty vase. There were no apologies, instead the manager told him that once the flowers leave the store they are no longer responsible for them- implying that it wasn't a faulty vase but that someone else had done something to it.

I've paid my bill just so I don't need to deal with this company anymore. If you goto this clinic I recommend have very good insurance that's pays everything for you or to pay everything up front before you leave the building.\n\nNot to mention the fact the last time I was here I thought I dislocated my leg which was swollen and unable to bend or walk on, but my doctor tells me I don't need x-rays or MRI cause I should just be able to  walk it off.

I took a friend there as it was near my house. I liked that he told him some of the vape pens he was looking at weren't really very good. And it wasn't the cheaper ones only. He recommended against several higher priced pens, recommending a few that were lower in price, and only one that was more expensive. This impressed me, as my friend was picking out cool looking but more expensive pens.

Almost every brand of protein powder, pre workout, and BCAAs. Oh my gosh where has this place been my whole life!! The best part is that if you take a supplement regularly they can send it straight to your house, and you get it cheaper that way!!! like really? This is way more than just a vitamin shop. It’s a fit persons dream land! It also is waaaaaay cheaper than GNC and has WAY more, and the staff actually know what they’re talking about.

Horrible online ordering system. Horrible customer service. Items are promised to be in stock on the website, order placed, and then items sold to another customer. These are new items. Even though I never received the item, I am told my credit card is charged anyways and it will be *days* before a refund is issued. GameStop did not even speak to me about the problem; I had to find out in an e-mail. The e-mail did nothing to give information or offer help. GameStop could at least have a real person attempt to contact the customer to resolve the issue. GameStop then sent me a link to offer feedback on their web site, which I did. Only to have GameStop edit my review and change the parts they did not like! \n\nAnd if that is not bad enough, I ordered my items with a sale price and since parts of my order were cancelled by Game Stop, I am no longer receiving the good deal offered on the website. And no replacement item offered. Game Stop makes no attempt to fix the situation or assist the customer in any way. There is no customer service. \n\nIf I were to try to find what I was looking for, I would be forced to drive to 10 different Game Stop locations, across the Metro Area, to fulfill the order they cancelled. Or pay $6 per item to ship to their own store (online competitors do not charge to have items shipped to store and picked up by customer).  I called customer service on the phone, the operator was totally clueless and had no way to help me. If Game Stop cannot fill an order, they need to make an effort to communicate to the customer in person, and provide an alternative or replacement. \n\nThere should also be a clear disclaimer on their website about their ordering policies, and warning customers that just because you \"order\" an item does NOT mean you will actually receive what you have ordered.\n\nI attempted to do business at Game Stop at 1484 University Ave W\nSaint Paul, MN 55104.","time":1582265793},{"author_name":"Kauther Ahmed","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104435288895130133311/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.ggpht.com/-aG-z4_hYXoQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Jki2F6vazsE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Omg o just bought a 2 10k robux gift card and they are so cheap visit this store is the best game store 🤘😻😻😻😻😻","time":1586985387},{"author_name":"Noemi Rivera","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116963164653590147382/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.ggpht.com/-xcbOcqoBuqI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/qXalKRmPZfo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"I went to the game stop in Eagan Minnesota and I want to thank the young man that was there he was great and helpful he was very informative thank you for treating us so well","time":1584474471},{"author_name":"Jaci Willis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106233129686061056322/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.ggpht.com/-m_TYZxXQ3vc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/whbppWCAYhQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"So I bought the PS4 bundle on Black Friday.

So I went down to the store and got the loveseat version instead, which was slightly cheaper, and the salesperson was so nice and didn't charge me another delivery fee! (Even though he said he should.) They just called it even since I was technically downgrading. Very accommodating and polite staff, and I got my loveseat the same day.

I was near St Louis Park,  so decided to stop in quick and pick up a phone charger cord. There were two people working in the store and each had a customer. I walked in and no one acknowledged me,  which is never a great feeling in a small store like this,  but whatever.. Went first to one wall, no cords, looked over on the opposite wall then realized they were on the back wall. As I walked up to the back wall to view, the gal working nearest the back says in a condescending voice, \"Ma'am I can put you on the waiting list.\" I looked up kind of startled as all four looked at me and said, huh there's a waiting list? (There was no one waiting) I kind of mumbled something to her about \"Oh I'm just picking up a cord\" and she proceeds again with the condescending voice to tell me they can take my information and maybe help me soon depending on something yada yada\". The beef I have was simply being made to feel like an unwelcome intruder in their shop while I was simply shopping for a cord and minding my own business. I just walked out and bought a cord at Walgreens where the gal didn't have an attitude and provided friendly assistance. You lost me as a customer at your location lady. My next upgrade won't be with you.","time":1538865620},{"author_name":"Cecil

I'm getting ready for bed, open the box, and the most important component isn't in the box! Irate, I return to the store at 1am. The manager on 1/26/2020 was helpful, understanding and flexible. They helped to apply the same discount from 1/25/2020 (that expired at midnight) on a replacement, and offered another discount for my trouble having to come back so late. They recommended opening the replacement box before I left to confirm I had all the components, a very smart recommendation. I've also had very helpful experiences from the pharmacy staff both in the store and through the drive through. Prescriptions are usually filled faster than promised. My only concern about this store is that the layout isn't logical or intuitive. All of the sexual health and feminine hygiene products are aisles away from the medications and pharmacy, which is unlike other Walgreens stores. The signage is low in the aisles, so I spend more time than I'd prefer searching for products. Overall, helpful experiences in a bright and clean store. The parking lot is often at capacity in evenings, it might be easier to just park on the street when possible.","time":1580026741},{"author_name":"Chris Nelson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103342329211533203855/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.ggpht.com/-hRgYLfETbPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/6wE1QN3s39k/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"A bit of a tale of woes when a Walgreens is described as a \"24 hour pharmacy\" yet in all actuality and in fact in reality is NOT a \"24 hour pharmacy\" it was closed at 12am and not to open again until 6am.","time":1575959010},{"author_name":"Leon Reed","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106570458234398524134/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.ggpht.com/-R5782Zp3_Ko/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/gV8fdBA79ns/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"They didn't have any toilet paper on the shelf so I asked to use the restroom and I used the employee's bathroom.

I would normally say that I'm outraged. But in this time of crisis I will just say that I am sorely disappointed by the lack of service, the deplorable attitude and the blatant disregard for the customer experience at Hudson Hardware. The COVID 19 crisis has made everything we do more challenging and \"essential\" services are just that. Essential, for both the people AND the business, because we all must survive this. I think its fair to say that when this crisis is past , we will remember and be grateful for those businesses that were there for us, that courageously remained open and helped us procure what little goods we could get, and that we needed to keep us feeling sane. I think its also fair to say that this is a time of great opportunity for people and businesses alike to show each other compassion, fortitude and integrity. Well....NOT SO for this sleepy little neighborhood hardware store that I've worried for in the past due to lack of customers even in the best of times. It seems they have chosen to plummet into a place of being self centered, self absorbed and down right self righteous in every aspect. Here's what happened. We went in with our masks and gloves on to get some screws, nuts and bolts. As usual there were only a handful of customers in the store. There was a manager in the center, standing behind a desk, arms folded, barking orders at 3 employees on the floor. We asked one of the employees for some assistance. He then asked the manager if it was okay if he went to the back of the store with us(?). The manager said in a very loud almost hostile voice. \"Yes, but if I need you up here you'll have to come back immediately\". No sooner than we got to where we were going, he was called back to help another customer. YES! He was called away from helping us to help someone else. As my partner tried to find what we needed on her own, I wandered around a bit and noticed that the manager continued to just stand there behind the desk as two employees stocked shelves, the other standing at the cash register. After hitting a dead end in finding what we needed, my partner then went back to the manager and said. \"I need some help\". He turned around and barked. \"Can't you see we're swamped?!! I said. \"Well. Maybe YOU could help us find what we need instead of standing behind your desk?\" He yells at me. \"I'M DIRECTING!\" I was so taken aback I didn't have the where with all to ask just exactly why or what he was directing. We just left. As I said earlier, these are challenging times for everybody, especially our essential workers and businesses, but are these times so unprecedented that we can't expect to be treated with dignity? In this time in which we are being forced to slow down I invite everyone who reads this review to take some of the extra time at hand and think about what CAN we expect, if anything?  How do we want to treat each other and how do we wish to be treated right now? I don't expect sunshine and rainbows from every essential worker with which I interact, but I also don't expect to be humiliated... Memory being what it is I know it will be the only thing I remember about Hudson Hardware and that makes me sad, but I won't go back there. I will miss Bolt the resident cat very much.","time":1587837354},{"author_name":"Ciera Hardyman","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115383344991420498213/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.ggpht.com/-FUBa3Q2988w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/k7HpTCX--Qc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Amazing service.

They said it needed a thermostat.  I let them try that.  That wasn't it.  Next they said it was the radiator, so they replaced that with a new radiator.  That wasn't it.  Then they said for sure it was the water pump, and they should probably replace the timing chain while they were in there.  So I let them try that.  That wasn't it.  Next they said it was the EBV valve, so they replaced that.  That wasn't it.  Then they decided it was the head gasket and it's easier to replace the engine than to fix that.  So I junked the car and got $250 for it.  It had 116,000 miles on it.  They didn't charge me for the EBV valve, but I paid almost $2,000 for all that work -- eight times what I could get for the car when they were done.\n\nI live down the street and I've gone to this place for years.  Something happened a few years ago and they just aren't doing good work anymore.  They used to give me so much service for so little money that I wondered how they were surviving.  Now they give me so little in return for so much money that I won't be going back.\n\nWere they scamming me?  Well, it isn't possible to distinguish incompetence from corruption, I guess, but I was suspicious when they did the pressure test on the radiator and found nothing, but the next day figured out that a crack in the radiator that was causing my problems.

I know someone who worked with the Wells Fargo insurance division and they are liars and try to withhold crucial information when working with insurance carriers. I’ve never had a problem with other banks before. ALL divisions of this bank are horrible! Again, the employees at the two Minneapolis locations I’ve been to are kind and great with people. The Wells Fargo bank overall, is a 0 out of 10. I’m guessing the top management is so far removed from the frontline workers and their clients that they forget what really matters. Wells Fargo needs to invest more in their employees and safety. I will be moving my account elsewhere. I should’ve known better. Don’t bank with this arrogant, uncaring bank. Don’t bank here!!!

Several months ago at Franklin Seward and then a month ago at 38th St. Seward, upon using their restrooms I was confronted with a poster about how to be gender neutral. Part of the advice included calling whoever \"friend\". Which was funny because I had recently experienced that at another store in Minneapolis. After being called friend several times by the clerk (who I did not know) I felt uncomfortable. Now, back to the last Seward restroom visited. After waiting for the man to come out of the restroom and then entering the restroom I was confronted not only with the gender neutral sign but a toilet seat covered in yellow pee. This is not the first time that has happened to me in a gender neutral restroom. After cleaning up the pee and spreading more clean toilet paper on the seat, yeah, I got to use the toilet. My thought was sir, you are no gentleman when thinking of the man who had just walked out of the restroom. How about a sign seen many years ago in restrooms (as told to me by my father) WE AIM TO PLEASE AND YOUR GOOD AIM WILL PLEASE US. Or another sign seen recently by me at another establishment, WE'RE NOT YOUR MOTHER CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF.

My husband and I were there shopping for a Honda PCX150. We were never acknowledged when entering the store or while browsing. I requested assistance after customers that came in behind me were helped. To my surprise once I had a salesperson’s attention they were short and rude. However, my husband was set in making a purchase so we continued pursuing our options.  We were quoted one price multiple times through our conversation. Unfortunately due to a restriction I set on my husband’s credit we were not able to walk away with a purchase until several days later. My husband stopped by to finalize the purchase alone not reviewing the sale price and signed away. The difference was not much, only $200. However, the response when questioning the price was unprofessional. There was no regard in making it right for a client even after I tried speaking to a Manager. I could go on to detail the conversation, but this is already long enough. Lesson learned... always go with your gut. Why we gave them our business after our first customer service encounter is beyond me. I never take the time to write reviews, but it is important to note customer service goes a long way.","time":1590196835},{"author_name":"CAM Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112283928288958223547/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.ggpht.com/-UeNYyRfzR5o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/TtraBACGcH0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Great place great people I just hope they don't never leave","time":1583559958},{"author_name":"Kel V","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115347692986166870275/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Cz2BZv68lxA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/yWJrUPKRUco/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"Very small selection of bike's.

The fact that that is needed shows the type of people that they work with. Red flag number one.\n\nOne of the employees got a gift from an ex, shortly after I walked in. I can't hold that against them, but it's uncomfortable. How do I know that? How do you think someone would know something like that? It's not hard to figure out.\n\n I had to redo a part of my application. I didn't have my password so I had to get it from my web browser, but my phone is currently off. I asked for the Wi-Fi password. The person told me that they don't have Wi-Fi, even though they're are three Wi-Fi with the atlas name. There's a difference between \"we don't give out our Wi-Fi password\" and \"we don't have Wi-Fi.\" either the person lied, or they don't know how anything works at their job. Either way - Red flag number two.\n\nwhile I was waiting to talk to the person that was working with me while they were doing other things, someone that helped someone else asked if I need something. I told the person that I was working with someone else, and without me asking, that person distracted them from what they were doing to tell them that I'm waiting, which they already knew. Red flag number three.\n\nOn my way out, I wish to the person good luck with your situation, and someone else jumped into my conversation saying that they don't believe in luck. Of course, when I turned to confront them, they said \"just kidding\", and I briefly told the intruder off on exit. I take that as a commentary on why they need the RESPECT sign. Red flag number four.\n\nAs of this post, the restroom that they have is broken. You have to go somewhere else to use the restroom - which is much easier probably fixing those other ones.\n\nThat's a hard pass. I'm not telling anyone not to go, of you really need the work.

What a little gem.  I've tried their ciders at past ciderfest events, but never actually stopped in until this past weekend.  I can't believe I've missed this one! This is a new favorite.\n\nI visited on a beautiful Saturday recently and expected it to be jam packed.  Surprisingly there was not a huge crowd.  Our party of 4 instantly found a table.  The inside is decorated nicely and very clean. The noise level wasn't bad and everyone seemed happy and chill. There was 1 person working behind the bar which seemed fine.  No one was waiting long.  There is not a parking lot, only on-street parking.  We didn't have any trouble finding parking on a side block.  This is typical of many businesses in the city.\n\nI ordered a semi-sweet cider which I loved.  I also bought a bottle to take home which was not on tap.  They also serve wine, but I did not try any.  They also offered snacks (cheese, crackers, pizza).  I inquired about gluten-free options and was told the entire place/menu is gluten-free.  Love it!!
